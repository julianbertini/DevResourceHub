# DevResourceHub
An organized collection of favorite software development resources hand-picked by their respective enthusiasts.

## Rules
The rules are few and simple:
- Contribute articles/books/libraries/etc that you find/found useful
- Put your contributions in the correct home (folder), i.e. "React" or "CSS"
- If your contribution is more specific than the present directory structure, create a new subdirectory
- Feel free to add descriptions / thoughts that apply to the resource you're sharing

## Ideas for organization

- Organize by language, framework, and subject area
- Organize by solution or task, such as authentication, or routing
